        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
            Hi there, I'm Kristopher Keller from Arizona! Although I don't have a job at the moment, 
            I'm really interested in coding and spend a lot of my free time practicing and improving my skills.
             I'm passionate about coding and eventually,
             I'd love to become a coding teacher so that I can help others learn this valuable skill.
        </p>
        <p>
            When I'm not coding, I enjoy watching any TV show that catches my interest. 
            I also have a big heart for animals and currently have four dogs and five rabbits. 
            In my free time, I love to travel to California to visit Six Flags and enjoy some thrilling rides. Additionally,
             I enjoy reading manga as a way to unwind and escape into a different world.
        </p>
        <h1>Education</h1>
        <p>
            I'm currently attending West-MEC and pursuing my interest in coding. 
            I'm passionate about coding and I spend a lot of my free time practicing and improving my skills.
        </p>
        <p>
            Recently, I participated in a school app challenge and created a mobile app that earned me 2nd place.
             This experience gave me a lot of satisfaction and fueled my desire to pursue my passion further. In fact, 
            I'm currently working on my skills and aim to win first place at the FBLA nationals.
        </p>
        <p>
            When I'm not coding, I enjoy spending time with my four dogs and five rabbits. I also like to read manga as a way to relax and unwind.
        </p>
